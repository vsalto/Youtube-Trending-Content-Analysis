Project in the framework of my bootcamp in Ironhack - Final Project - DATA ANALYTICS
Info: https://shorturl.at/PBYk3 


Comprehensive analysis of trending YouTube videos within the Entertainment and People & Blogs categories (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset/data?select=US_youtube_trending_data.csv).
 
Using K-means clustering, I identified distinct content trends and engagement patterns. The analysis included:

- Textual Clustering: Videos were grouped based on textual similarities in their titles. This clustering was performed monthly to track evolving trends.
- Behavioral Clustering: Videos were also clustered based on engagement metrics such as views, likes, comments etc.

Data-Insights:

- Event-Driven Trends: Certain trends were closely tied to specific events, such as Christmas, back-to-school periods, the Oscars, and new TV series seasons.
- Highly Engaged Content: Videos that garnered high engagement often focused on personal and relatable content, including themes like baby announcements, pregnancy journeys, gender reveals, and house tours.

Data-Driven Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can help optimize content strategy:

- Leverage Seasonal Trends: Create and promote content aligned with major events and holidays. This can include themed videos, collaborations, and special series timed around these periods.
- Focus on Relatable Topics: Personal and life event-related content tends to attract high engagement. Emphasize authenticity and share personal stories to build a stronger connection with the audience.
- Monitor Monthly Trends: Continuously track and adapt to emerging trends. This involves staying updated with current events and incorporating trending topics into your content plan.


Potential Applications
This analysis can be applied in various ways to enhance content strategy:

- Content Planning: Use clustering insights to plan a content calendar that aligns with popular trends and events.
- Audience Engagement: Identify topics that resonate with viewers and tailor content to meet their interests and preferences.
- Marketing Campaigns: Design targeted marketing campaigns around high-engagement themes and peak periods identified through clustering.

Limitations
- Data Limitation/Quality: Include viewer demographics, traffic sources and revenue information (non-public data). Textual data are user-generated might have limited accuracy and be noisy. 
- Methods: Refined clustering techniques.
- Youtube Niche: Focused content analysis on specific youtube niches (e.g. Travel, Beauty, Food, Music etc).
- Engagement Metrics: Wider range of engagement metrics (shares, dislikes, social platforms traffic) with appropriate weighting.
